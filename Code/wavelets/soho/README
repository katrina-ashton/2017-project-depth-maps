SOURCE CODE
-----------

This code implements the symmetric and orthogonal spherical Haar wavelets developed by Lessig and Fiume and allows to reproduce the published results [1]. A simple example on how to use the code can be found in runSimpleExperiment.m. We also provide code for the computation of rotation matrices for spherical Haar wavelets and a simple implementation of Spherical Harmonics (following the one outlined by Green [2]) which allows to compare spherical Haar wavelets and spherical Harmonics. The program code has been tested with Matlab 7.X.

The Spherical Harmonics directory contains some code from Frederick J. Simmons (http://geoweb.princeton.edu/people/simons/software.html) and we also employ the matlabPyrTools toolbox by Eero P. Simoncelli (http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/software.php) which is contained in the utility/ directory.
